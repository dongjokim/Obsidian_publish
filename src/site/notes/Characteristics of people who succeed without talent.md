First, be diligent.

Some people may feel discouraged when they hear this. After all, everyone knows that one should be diligent. However, not many people actually put this into practice. It's rare to find someone who practices and improves their skills consistently, rain or shine. Even if one has exceptional talent, it will rust away quickly without diligence. Let us not forget that cultivating talent requires diligence, as does creating new talent.

Second, constantly challenge yourself.

No matter how hard you work, you won't improve if you keep doing the same thing. Those who exhibit outstanding abilities are those who constantly challenge themselves to break out of their comfort zones. If what you're doing right now is boring or has become too familiar, it's a sign that it's time to step out of your comfort zone. Try taking on a slightly more challenging task in a situation that's just slightly unfamiliar to you. If you keep doing this, you'll soon find that the task that was once difficult has become familiar. Let's not forget that masters constantly polished their skills by constantly challenging themselves.

Third, know the power of habit.

Many people wonder how others can always exert effort. However, experts turn difficult processes into "habits." Habits mean not having to exert effort. There's a famous clip of Kim Yuna doing stretches during her training. When a reporter asked what she was thinking about, Kim Yuna replied with a blank expression, "What do you mean? I'm just doing it." That's right. The experts turned what they thought was difficult into a habit so that they didn't have to exert effort. Remember, habit is not merely an activity that you force yourself to do every day. Habit is a very powerful, automatic system that allows you to accomplish difficult tasks without even trying.
